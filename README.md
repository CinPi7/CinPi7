 # :wave: Hello, world!
 
 ## :white_heart:	About me 
<p>I'm Cinthia, passionate about software engineering, information, and communication. </p>
<p>My childhood was in a small city in Brazil, a peaceful place to live, which led me to grow and develop a special affection for technology. I'm currently living in FlorianÃ³polis, Brazil.</p>

## :rocket:	My Experience 
<p>As a Front-end Developer, I have over three years of experience in creating user experiences for web applications that are user-friendly, interactive, intuitive, responsive, and scalable. I am always eager to improve and learn new skills, explore new challenges, and collaborate with others who share the passion and understanding for valuable purposes and good practices.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several projects, either in the health or financial industry, where I could further enhance my experience. My expertise lies in JavaScript, React, Angular, Material Design, and other front-end technologies and frameworks. I also have a solid background in Information and Communication Technologies, with a degree from the Federal University of Santa Catarina and an exchange program in Canada. I have a keen interest in the intersection of psychology, design, and technology, and how they influence human behavior and society.</p>

<p>Additionally, Iâ€™ve been polishing skills in problem-solving and assertive communication, increasing my understanding and perspectives.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about research, collaboration, programming, and creativity!</p>

<br />
