  <p>
    I'm Cinthia, a web developer based in Florian√≥polis, Brazil. <br />
    My background goes to Information and Communication Technology and I'm focused on web experiences. <br />
    My childhood was at a small city in Brazil, a really peaceful place to live. That led my curiosity to grow and goes from psychology, design and     technology. <br />
    If you have something beautiful to share with the world, I can help you with that. <br />
    Interested in a collab? I'm available for freelance sideprojects. Just say "ol√°!" <br />
